# Android-News-Reader


This was an assignment to create a simple news reader Android app. It retrieves a list of news sources (or articles) from the web to display, and the user can read any of them with a built in web view.

The server it retrieved articles from is no longer running. This repo exists as an archive of my work for class and for my own reference.
